title: Sub-Labeling and Big Data
description: ML model improvement with sub labeling
---

I recently read an interesting chain and article on Reddit about the Facebook (FB) AI labeling accident. This reminded me of a labeling issue I came across once early in my ML career and found the solution to be very helpful. A solution that these large companies should take into consideration. I will not go into details on the FB issue but in summary, FB made an AI that was miss labeling images and something similar happened with Google a while back. When I first started working with image recognition machine learning (ML) models, my first model was really miss labeling a specific label. I was training a model to recognize vegetables in order to measure them digitally. My images included a full vegetable and a half section of the vegetable along with a plot tag. My labels were the vegetable, the center of the vegetable, and the plot tag, so three labels in total. After training, I found that the model was having a very hard time telling the difference between the half section and the center apart. In my mind they were very different, at least some what, but It was frustrating because the other labels it was recognizing extremely well even though I thought they were more challenging to detect compared to the center of the vegetable and the half section. After some discussion in my group I was recommended to try and label the full vegetable and half as two different labels which meant I would then have four labels, full vegetable, half cut vegetable, center, and the plot tag. After doing this new sub labeling the model worked perfectly. 

## Example of sub-labeling
On the left is an object labeling that can be improved to sub labels like in the right image.

The model could now very well distinguish each object from one another and produce very tight bounding boxes. I would have never thought that such simple sub labeling could have help so much. After reading the discussion about the FB and Google issue, this sub setting could be a very simple fix that can have massive improvement on your model. However, many times you donâ€™t know this is an issue until you test you model, but you should also extensively test your models in your desired environments before releasing into production. I am no expert in any of these topics but these are some fairly simple things I learned early on in my experience. In conclusion of my experience with miss labeling models is try to sub label things into more specific if you can and test you model not only in your intended environment but also outside of it to get an idea of what will happen. This is my words of advice. Happy modeling :)
