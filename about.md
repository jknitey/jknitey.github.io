<img src="/assets/img/jknight.png"> | Hello, my name is Josh Knight and I am a data scientist in agriculture. I currently work at Nutrien doing computational science focused on seed data. This blog was an idea for me to help fill in gaps I find between vegetable agriculture and data science. I hope someone can find this useful.
